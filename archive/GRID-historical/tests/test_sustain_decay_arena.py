"""
Test Suite: Sustain/Decay Mechanisms in Arena (The Chase)

================================================================================
MAIN TOPIC OF DISCUSSION: Sustain/Decay Semantics Across Systems
================================================================================

This test suite explores the relationship between:
1. ADSR Envelope (application/resonance/adsr_envelope.py)
   - Sustain: Maintained amplitude level during activity
   - Decay: Exponential drop from peak to sustain level

2. Arena Cache Layer (Arena/the_chase/python/src/the_chase/core/cache.py)
   - Sustain: Cache entries maintaining priority/state over time
   - Decay: TTL expiration, priority reduction, behavioral contrast

3. Arena Reward System (Arena/the_chase/python/src/the_chase/overwatch/rewards.py)
   - Sustain: Honor/reward levels maintained over time
   - Decay: Natural decay of honor without new achievements

================================================================================
PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

1. MISSING DECAY MECHANISM IN REWARD STATES
   - CharacterRewardState tracks honor growth but has no explicit decay
   - Honor should naturally decay over time without new achievements
   - Reward levels should de-escalate if no activity (mirroring penalty escalation)
   - Current: Honor only grows, never decays (unlike reputation in penalty system)

2. NO EXPLICIT SUSTAIN PHASE TRACKING IN CACHE
   - Cache entries have TTL but no explicit "sustain period" concept
   - ADSR envelope has sustain_time parameter, cache doesn't
   - Cache sustain is implicit (entry exists until TTL expires)
   - Missing: Explicit sustain phase where priority/state is maintained

3. DISCONNECT BETWEEN ADSR ENVELOPE AND ARENA SYSTEMS
   - ADSR envelope is in application/resonance/ (activity feedback)
   - Arena cache/rewards are in Arena/the_chase/ (game simulation)
   - No integration between ADSR sustain/decay and Arena's behavioral feedback
   - Opportunity: Map ADSR phases to Arena reward/penalty states

4. TTL-BASED DECAY IS BINARY, NOT GRADUAL
   - Cache entries expire instantly (hard TTL) or not at all
   - ADSR decay is gradual (exponential curve from peak to sustain)
   - Missing: Gradual priority/priority decay over time in cache
   - Current: Priority is static until expiration

5. REWARD STATE DECAY NOT IMPLEMENTED
   - RewardEscalator has escalation but no de-escalation
   - Honor should decay naturally (e.g., 0.01 per day without achievements)
   - Reward levels should step down: PROMOTED → REWARDED → ACKNOWLEDGED → NEUTRAL
   - Current: Once promoted, always promoted (no natural decay)

================================================================================
TEST COVERAGE
================================================================================

This suite tests:
- Cache entry sustain (maintaining state over time)
- Cache entry decay (TTL expiration, priority reduction)
- Reward state sustain (honor maintained with achievements)
- Reward state decay (honor/reward level decay without activity)
- Integration between ADSR concepts and Arena systems
- Behavioral contrast in sustain/decay (rewards vs penalties)

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. CACHE SUSTAIN/DECAY:
   ✅ Cache entries sustain priority during TTL lifetime
   ✅ Rewarded entries sustain longer (extended TTL)
   ✅ Penalized entries decay faster (reduced TTL)
   ❌ No explicit sustain phase tracking (implicit via TTL)
   ❌ Priority is static (no gradual decay like ADSR)

2. REWARD STATE SUSTAIN/DECAY:
   ✅ Honor sustains with regular achievements
   ✅ Reward levels sustain with continued good behavior
   ❌ Honor does NOT decay naturally (only grows)
   ❌ Reward levels do NOT de-escalate (only escalate)

3. ADSR ↔ ARENA INTEGRATION:
   ✅ ADSR Attack maps to reward escalation
   ✅ ADSR Decay maps to priority reduction
   ✅ ADSR Sustain maps to maintained state
   ✅ ADSR Release maps to TTL expiration
   ❌ No explicit integration code (conceptual mapping only)

4. BEHAVIORAL CONTRAST:
   ✅ Rewarded entities sustain longer, decay slower
   ✅ Penalized entities sustain shorter, decay faster
   ✅ Semantic contrast creates behavioral feedback loop

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. IMPLEMENT HONOR DECAY:
   - Add decay_honor() method to CharacterRewardState
   - Honor should decay naturally (e.g., 0.01 per day without achievements)
   - Mirror reputation decay in penalty system

2. IMPLEMENT REWARD LEVEL DE-ESCALATION:
   - Add de_escalate_reward_level() method
   - Reward levels should step down if no achievements for extended period
   - PROMOTED → REWARDED → ACKNOWLEDGED → NEUTRAL

3. ADD GRADUAL PRIORITY DECAY:
   - Implement priority decay curve (exponential decay over time)
   - Similar to ADSR decay_curve parameter
   - Priority should gradually decrease during entry lifetime

4. ADD EXPLICIT SUSTAIN PHASE TRACKING:
   - Add sustain_time parameter to CacheMeta
   - Track explicit sustain phase (like ADSR sustain_time)
   - Separate from TTL (sustain is active period, TTL is total lifetime)

5. CREATE ADSR-ARENA INTEGRATION MODULE:
   - Map ADSR phases to Arena behavioral states
   - Create unified sustain/decay semantics
   - Bridge application/resonance/ and Arena/the_chase/
