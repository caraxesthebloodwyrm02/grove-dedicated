"""
Event-Driven I/O Core Module for GRID.

Provides the foundational event system for decoupled, scalable processing
with event sourcing, middleware support, and correlation tracking.

Key Components:
- Event: Core event data structure with correlation tracking
- EventBus: Central event dispatcher with subscription management
- EventType: Enumeration of standard event types
- EventMiddleware: Protocol for event middleware
- EventStore: In-memory event storage with query support

Features:
- Decoupled architecture through event-driven communication
- Correlation ID tracking for request tracing
- Middleware pipeline for cross-cutting concerns
- Event sourcing with queryable event store
- Async and sync event emission support
- Priority-based event handling

Example:
    >>> from grid.events import EventBus, Event, EventType
    >>> bus = EventBus()
    >>> bus.subscribe(EventType.CLI_INPUT, lambda e: print(f"Received: {e.data}"))
    >>> bus.emit(Event(type=EventType.CLI_INPUT, data={"command": "analyze"}))
