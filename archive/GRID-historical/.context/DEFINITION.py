GRID Cognitive Intelligence (GCI) Framework - Core Definitions

This module defines the foundational elements of the GRID Cognitive Intelligence framework,
including the 9 cognition patterns, core data structures, and cognitive functions.

The framework models human-like cognitive processes including perception, attention,
pattern recognition, emotional tagging, and motor preparation with background factors
